            "title": "API Documentation",
            "content": "Metasmoke offers an API to access data in JSON format about posts, reasons, and feedback. This is the documentation for said API.If you’re looking for the WebSocket API, go here.Getting StartedTo get started, you’ll need an API key. No application can use the API without a key - you’ll get a 403 response. To get a key, ping a metasmoke admin in chat - they’ll be able to register one for you. Have a name in mind for your app - a name is necessary to register a key. You can edit it later, so it doesn’t have to be final. Also make sure that you have an active metasmoke account - this allows the registering admin to tie the key to your account, giving you control of your app.Once you have your key, you should include it as the key query string parameter on all requests to the API.FiltersThe metasmoke API supports parameter-based filters (like the Stack Exchange API) so that you can filter a response down to only the fields you want.To create a filter, visit metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/api/filters and select the fields you want in the response. Only select the fields you need. Selecting fields from unrelated tables may break things.  N.B.: You can calculate filters yourself if you really want to, but you should have a thorough understanding of how to do so first. Ask ArtOfCode if you’re unsure.Once you’ve got your filter, include it as the filter parameter on requests to the API that use it.Write MethodsWrite methods additionally require you to go through OAuth to get hold of a write token, which can be used to authorize the write request. You should follow this flow:  Send your user to https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/oauth/request?key=YOUR_KEY_HERE  If the user authorizes your app, they’ll be given a code to provide you. Ask them to enter that code, then:  Send an HTTP GET request to https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/oauth/token?key=YOUR_KEY_HERE&amp;code=THEIR_CODE_HERE. The response is a JSON object containing one key, token, the value of which is your write token.Write tokens do not expire and can be used to authorize as many requests as you need. If you get a 401 Unauthorized response when you included a write token, that token has likely been revoked by an administrator or by the user, and you need to go through OAuth again.API Read Routes  Blacklisted Websites: /api/blacklist  Post Feedback: /api/post/:id/feedback  Post Reasons: /api/post/:id/reasons  Posts by Date Range: /api/posts/between  Posts by Feedback: /api/posts/feedback  Posts by ID: /api/posts/:ids  Posts by Site: /api/posts/site  Posts by URLs: /api/posts/url  Posts caught by reason: /api/reason/:id/posts  Reasons by ID: /api/reasons/:ids  Search Posts: /api/posts/search  Undeleted Posts: /api/posts/undeleted  Valid Feedback Types: /api/post/:id/valid_feedbackAPI Write Routes  Create Feedback: POST /api/w/post/:id/feedback  Report Post: POST /api/w/post/report",

            "content": "State of the ProjectWe are looking into automating flags from Smokey.  Basically, it will look as if though Smokey clicks “flag” → “spam” as soon as Smoke Detector reports a post (though not all reported posts are eligible; see the Spam weight section for details.).We are working out the specifics of the system right now, so the details are still in flux.To participate in the development of this feature, please show up in the Charcoal HQ chat room and wait for a good moment to bring up your topic (afternoon UTC seems to be a fairly busy time in the room).The main dashboard (status, statistics, etc) is at https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flaggingTechnical details and spam weightEvery time a post is reported, it triggers a variety of different reasons for being reported (such as bad keyword, blacklisted website, etc). Each of these reasons (also known as “heuristics”) contributes to the post’s weight. The formula that determines how much weight each reason contributes is as follows:[Number of True Positives caught by reason] / [Total posts caught by the reason] * 100In our current preliminary testing, the threshold that was set for posts to be flagged automatically is at a weight of 280. In our database of over 50,000 records, this score threshold has a predictive accuracy of 99.98% (meaning of all posts hitting 280 score caught by Smokey, 99.98% were true positives).As with any other projection, you need to understand that past performance is no guarantee for the future.The flagging is done by Metasmoke (the back end component) using the credentials of users who have signed up to allow the system to cast flags on their behalf.Opting InThere is a separate page about Setting up Autoflagging.  This brief section is a quick FAQ-like summary.There is a “big red button” which you can click.  Please be patient and try again until it actually sticks!  This is a known issue which of course we hope to resolve eventually.Once your flagging status shows as active (the button stays checked if you navigate away from the page and come back again) and your conditions are met, you are eligible to be drawn randomly when a flag is about to be raised.  This is a random selection out of the list of users whose conditions allow flagging at the given weight on the given site.You can review the flags cast on your behalf at a URL like https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/users/XX/logs (for example, Undo’s log).  There is a number of other useful links on the personal flagging dashboard where you can tweak conditions or turn off autoflagging.",

            "content": "This wiki page contains a list of commands and their explanation.Commands for everyoneThese commands can be executed by everyone.  !!/alive - Replies a random message taken from a list so you can see that SmokeDetector is still running.  (Reply message is constant in Charcoal HQ.)  !!/status - Shows the UTC date when SmokeDetector started running.  !!/rev or !!/ver - Shows the running Git revision.  !!/help, !!/info, !!/commands - Shows a small help message about SmokeDetector.  !!/apiquota - Shows the remaining API quota of SmokeDetector.  !!/queuestatus - Shows the queue status of BodyFetcher.  !!/blame - Chooses randomly from a list of people who have talked recently in the room.  !!/lick, !!/wut, !!/coffee, !!/tea, and !!/brownie - better versions of !!/alive, aka ‘fun’ commands.  !!/location - Replies with the current location, as set in the config file.  !!/test &lt;string&gt; - Runs &lt;string&gt; against the filter as if it appeared in a question title, body, or username. To test specifically, use !!/test-a for answer, !!/test-q for question body, !!/test-t for title, or !!/test-u for username.  !!/isblu, !!/iswlu - Checks if a user is blacklisted/whitelisted. Two formats are accepted: &lt;profile_URL&gt; or &lt;user_ID&gt; &lt;site_name&gt;  !!/whoami - Replies with the bot’s user id for that site  !!/amiprivileged - Lets you know if you are in the list of privileged users  !!/amicodeprivileged - Lets you know whether or not you have code privileges (i.e. you can blacklist without approval)  !!/notify &lt;chatroom_ID_number&gt; &lt;site_domain&gt; - Tells SmokeDetector to ping you, in the given chatroom, when a post is reported on the given site.  Example:  !!/notify 89 parenting.stackexchange.com-  Note: Please use the squelch suffix (-) and avoid spamming the chat room with too many requests. See this chat message and the surrounding context.  !!/unnotify &lt;chatroom_ID_number&gt; &lt;site_domain&gt; - Cancels the previously set notification.  Also accepts the silent mode suffix (-).  !!/willibenotified &lt;chatroom_ID_number&gt; &lt;site_domain&gt; - Reports whether you will be pinged, in the given room, about spam on the given site.  !!/allnotificationsites &lt;chatroom_ID_number&gt; - Shows all sites that you will be pinged for in the given room.Commands as reply for everyone  why - Shows the reason that SmokeDetector caught a post.Note that why data is only kept for the last 50 reports. If you need to see older data, it can be found in the post record on Metasmoke.  autoflagged - Returns if the post was autoflagged or not, and if so, what users were used.Privileged commandsThese commands require privileges.  !!/report &lt;post URL 1&gt; [&lt;post URL 2&gt; [...]] - Makes SmokeDetector report a specific post/multiple specific posts in Charcoal HQ and Tavern on the Meta. The originator of each post will be added to the blacklist. Maximally 5 at a time.  !!/allspam &lt;user URL&gt; - To be used if a spammer has many posts so you don’t have to use !!/report. This command posts a message about the user in all applicable rooms.  Note that this command does NOT auto-TPU anything, for various reasons. It has an alias, !!/reportuser &lt;user URL&gt;  !!/blacklist &lt;regex&gt; - This command is deprecated. Use one of the three specialized blacklist commands instead, which are shown below. If run, this command will print a help  !!/blacklist-website &lt;regex&gt; - Adds a regular expression pattern to the website blacklist. Make sure regex special characters are escaped (in particular . characters should be escaped as \\.). If you are a code admin on metasmoke, your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes so that they can be reviewed.  !!/blacklist-keyword &lt;regex&gt; - Adds a regular expression pattern to the list of bad keywords. Just like !!/blacklist-website, if you are a code admin on metasmoke your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes to that they can be reviewed.  !!/blacklist-username &lt;regex&gt; - Adds a regular expression pattern to the username blacklist. Just like !!/blacklist-website and !!/blacklist-keyword, if you are a code admin on metasmoke your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes to that they can be reviewed.  !!/addwlu &lt;profile_URL&gt; or !!/addwlu &lt;user_ID&gt; &lt;site_name&gt; - Adds a user to the whitelist (this means that if the username for that user matches one of the regexes, this will be ignored).  !!/rmwlu &lt;profile_URL&gt; or !!/rmwlu &lt;user_ID&gt; &lt;site_name&gt; - Removes a user from the whitelist.  !!/addblu (same syntax as !!/addwlu) - Adds a user to the blacklist (this means that any post of this user will be reported).  !!/rmblu (same syntax as !!/rmwlu) - Removes a user from the blacklist.  !!/reboot - Reboots SmokeDetector.  !!/stappit - Stops all SmokeDetector instances.  !!/stappit &lt;string&gt; - Stops all SmokeDetector instances where string is included in the location (e.g. !!/stappit undo would stop Undo/EC2 and Undo/DO, but not teward/aroura  !!/pull - Pulls new revisions from GitHub.  !!/master - When SmokeDetector enters reverted mode, use this command to go back to the master branch.  !!/errorlogs &lt;N&gt; - Shows the last N lines of the error logs.  !!/block &lt;N&gt; - Blocks SmokeDetector globally for N seconds; no alerts will be posted. Example: !!/block 600 blocks globally for 10 minutes.  !!/block &lt;N&gt; &lt;room_id&gt; - Blocks SmokeDetector in the specific room for N seconds; no alerts will be posted there. Example: !!/block 3600 89 blocks alerts in the Tavern for one hour.  !!/unblock - Unblock SmokeDetector manually, resetting global block only.  !!/unblock &lt;room_id&gt; - Unblock SmokeDetector manually in the specific room.Privileged commands as replyThese commands require privileges, and have to be posted as a reply to a message of SmokeDetector.User-friendly syntax:  use spam or rude or abusive or offensive for posts that should be flagged as such (equivalent to tpu-; see below)  use v, vand or vandalism for posts that have been vandalised and the vandalism edit should be rolled back (equivalent to tp-)  use notspam if the post should not be flagged (equivalent to fp-)Complete list:  tp or true - Marks a reported post as true positive.  tpu or trueu - Marks a reported post as true positive and adds the poster to the blacklist.  fp or false - Marks a reported post as false positive. Additionally removes the user from the blacklist, if that was the reason that the post was reported.  fpu or falseu - Marks a reported post as false positive and adds the poster to the whitelist.  naa - If the reported post is an answer, this command records it as NAA (Not an answer) in metasmoke.  ignore - Makes SmokeDetector ignore a reported post.  delete, del, remove or gone - Deletes a message of SmokeDetector.  postgone - Edits out the post link of a SmokeDetector report.Silent mode and aliasesIf you don’t want SmokeDetector to reply when executing a command, add a - sign at the end, for example fp-. This is a good practice to cut down on chatroom clutter.  Note that SmokeDetector will always report any errors, even if the - is present. The hyphen can be placed after the command itself, or after its parameter. The following commands support silent mode: replying to spam reports, managing black- and white-list, and managing chat notifications.Also, some frequently used commands have one-letter aliases, or convenient words that can be used instead:CommandAlias offfp-notspamfp-ktpu-spamtpu-rudetpu-abusetpu-abusivetpu-offensivetpu-vandalismtp-nnaa-Message deletionMessages by SmokeDetector can be deleted within 2 minutes after they were posted by using the del, remove, or gone commands. After 2 minutes are up, SmokeDetector cannot delete its own messages in response to those commands, so any deletion after that window must be done by a moderator.Messages will also be deleted in Tavern on the Meta and SO Close Vote Reviewers if the relevant post is deleted before the 2-minute window is up; this does not apply in Charcoal HQ.Messages will also be deleted in Tavern on the Meta and SO Close Vote Reviewers if they are fed back on as a false positive within the 2-minute window.Shortcut commandsYou can now use a shortcut to post a reply to one, two or three messagesat the same time, in this shape:sd cmd1sd cmd1 cmd2sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4 cmd5cmd1 will be invoked in the most recent message, cmd2 on the messagebefore that and cmd3 on the message before that, and so on.It’s also possible to skip a message. Replace a command by a - to skip amessage. For example, sd - delete skips the most recent message anddeletes the message before that one.Smokey will reply to your shortcut command, unless all commands have quietmode (like tp-) or just don’t reply by default (like delete).A few examples:  sd - delete keeps the most recent message and deletes the one before that.  sd tp fp delete marks the most recent message as tp, the one before that as fp, and deletes the one before that.You can also put a digit in front of a command so the command will apply as many times as the digit. A few examples:  sd 2tpu == sd tpu tpu  sd 2tpu 3fpu == sd tpu tpu fpu fpu fpu  sd 2- fp == sd - - fp",

            "title": "Creating new spam checks",
            "content": "  This document covers how to create a new spam check, which essentially turns out to be a guide on findspam.py.1. The B(are|ear) NecessitiesThe very first thing you need to do before creating a new spam check is test if it’s actually necessary.  What is your proposed check designed to catch?  Is it something that’s caught by existing checks? This includes regex-based pattern checks, blacklists, and check methods. Use the various !!/test commands to check this.  Is it something we want to catch? Remember that Smokey is designed to catch spam and/or abuse - anything else (low quality posts, not-an-answers, etc) is out of scope. There are plenty more moderation bots around the network that might want that kind of check, though.2. Write a Check…preferably addressed to me, with plenty of money involved. (Ha! Spelling jokes!)If you’ve determined that a new check is necessary, now you need to actually write it. The preferred way of doing this is a regex - these are (usually) simpler and easier to maintain than the alternatives. Writing a regex check is pretty easy: just write the regex. You can use regex-checking websites like regex101 to check if you’ve written it right - doing this is encouraged, because regex is not an easy language to speak.The alternative, which should only be used if a regex doesn’t do the job, is to write a check method. This is done by writing a new method in findspam.py, which takes two parameters: s and site. s is a string of stuff that you need to check (like the title, username, or post body), and site is the site that the post is on. Give your method a descriptive name, so that its purpose can be judged at a glance.Your method should return a pair of values. The first is a boolean, indicating whether or not you think the post is spam. The second is a string, which is the why data for the post (and if you don’t know what that means, you should probably be letting someone more experienced write the check - or go learn about it).Here’s an example check method. This method will say that any s longer than 3 characters is spam.def ridiculous_spam_check(s, site):    if len(s) &gt; 3:        return True, \"Length is greater than 3 characters\"    else:        return False, \"\"3. Endless ListsChecks are our ammunition against spam; now you need a gun to fire it from. In our case, it’s a GLOCK - a Giant List of Checks and Keywords.Scroll to the rules array, which is somewhere around line 312 in findspam.py. This structure describes all the checks that SmokeDetector runs, and how to apply them. (N.B.: It’s not actually JSON, don’t make that mistake - it’s Python dicts.)You need to add a new entry to this array that describes your check. The general format of this dictionary is:{    'regex': r\"Include your regex here if it's a regex-based check\",    'method': method_name,  # Pass the name of your method here if it's a method-based check,    'all': True,  # True if you want to scan all sites in the network, False otherwise,    'sites': [],  # If `all` is true, these sites are excluded; otherwise, they are the only sites to get scanned    'reason': \"Name of the reason you're categorising these posts as (bad keyword, link at end of body, etc)\",    'title': False,  # True if you want to scan post titles, False otherwise    'body': True,  # True if you want to scan post bodies, False otherwise    'username': False,  # True if you want to scan owner usernames, False otherwise    'body_summary': False,  # True if you want to scan body summaries, False otherwise    'stripcodeblocks': False,  # True if you want code removed before getting passed to your check    'max_rep': 20,  # Posts from users above this reputation will not be scanned    'max_score': 1,  # Posts scoring above this value will not be scanned}You should only include one of regex or method - checks should not be both at the same time.",

            "content": "Some aspects of feedback to SmokeDetector have historically caused confusion. This page is intended to address some of those confusions.Generic GuidanceIn very general terms, the litmus test for whether you should use k or f is this:  If SmokeDetector was implemented as a system-level block, would we want to catch this type of activity?If the answer to that question is yes, you should mark the post k. There are a few types of activity we have specific guidelines for, as outlined below.Disclosed affiliationIt’s fine to promote your own product or service on Stack Exchange, as long as:  you’re not doing it excessively  you disclose your affiliation  you only do so where relevantIf all of those conditions are true, then self-promotion is not spam and therefore f and not k (unless it doesn’t answer the question, in which case it’s n). If any of them are false, self-promotion is k.Self-vandalismSelf-vandalism is where a user vandalises their own post by replacing all its useful content with something like “xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx”, or “deleted deleted deleted”. For self-vandalism, use tp- (or one of its aliases, such as v, vand or vandalism). At a system level, we’d want to catch and block people doing this, but it’s not worth blacklisting the user because it’s usually a one-time incident. Most users, when warned, don’t do it again.Foreign-language posts on English sites (or vice versa)Treat these as you would an English post. If it’s spam, offensive, etc., then mark it as k; otherwise use f or n. Particularly, answers in the wrong language for the target site are NAA, so n. Being in the wrong language for the site alone doesn’t make a post k-able.PlagiarismPlagiarism - copying without attribution from another source such as someone else’s answer or another website - is not always easy to spot. If you do spot it in an answer, then mark it as k - you may wish to explain to other users in the chatroom why you’ve done that, to avoid arguments about what the feedback should be.If you get to a post before it’s deleted, an easy way to spot plagiarism is to check the other posts on the same page for similar content.However, while plagiarism should be marked as k, the !!/report command shouldn’t be used to report plagiarism - catching plagiarism is a bonus if we do, but we’re not aiming to catch it.NAA feedbackNAA feedback has sometimes been a little confusing. Using n as your feedback should, in general, be done if:  the post is not spam, abusive, offensive etc. (use k)  you would flag the post as Not An Answer on the site itself",

            "title": "What the website blacklist does:",
            "content": "What the website blacklist does:The website blacklist is one of the filters used by the spam detection bot SmokeDetector. It consists of a list of websites associated with known spam that automatically raise suspicion when posted anywhere on Stack Exchange.Blacklisting a website makes SmokeDetector report every post that is posted or modified with a link to the website (formatted as a link or otherwise) in its text. The website blacklist is maintained in the SmokeDetector GitHub repository, specifically in the file blacklisted_websites.txt.When to blacklist a website:Generally, it makes sense to blacklist a website if all of the following criteria are met:      Website has been used in at least 2 confirmed instances (tp fed back reports) of spam (You can use https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/search to find other instances of a website being used for spam).        Website is not used legitimately in other posts on Stack Exchange.        Website is not currently caught in either of these filters:          bad keyword in body      blacklisted website      pattern matching website      You can test this by using the **!!/test ** command. (or **!!/test-a ** to test as an answer).How to blacklist a website:Everyone with SmokeDetector privileges (if you don’t have those and would like them, read up on how to get them) can blacklist a website, though the action will require admin-approval for most people. Additions to the blacklist (via both methods) must be valid regular expressions (regex). In reality that means for largely exact matches (like the website blacklist) that you ensure that special characters (like .) are escaped. (Example: thisisspam\\.com)There are 2 methods to add a website to the blacklist:      Propose a change to the blacklisted_websites.txt file on GitHub and create a pull request specifying why you want to blacklist the website.        Use the “!!/blacklist-website \" command in any of the Smoke Detector chatrooms. This will create a pull request containing your change for you.  ",

            "title": "Privileges",
            "content": "SmokeDetector operates a privilege system. That is, before you are able to use a number of commands (most notably the feedback commands), you must be added to a list of privileged users in SmokeDetector’s code.Getting PrivilegedIn theory, anyone can be added to the privilege list. In practice, this doesn’t always work out, so as a general guideline, we look for a few things to indicate how qualified you are.      ReputationA higher reputation score indicates a higher level of participation on the sites, which is strongly correlated with moderation ability. We’re looking for enough rep to indicate that you’ve been around a little while: generally, 300 on one site will suffice.        ParticipationWe can also simply look through your various accounts on the network. SmokeDetector scans posts for spam network-wide, so the more sites you have accounts on, the better it is for everyone - more accounts means you can flag spam on more sites. We may also look at how active you’ve been on various sites (and on their meta sites) to determine how able you are to moderate content effectively. Again, we’re not looking for a massive or exceptional record, just enough to show that you know what you’re doing.        ReferralIf your request for privileges is supported by a regular of one of the chat rooms that SmokeDetector posts reports to, we’ll look more favourably upon it - we tend to trust people who are already part of the system to make sound judgements. Additionally, if you’ve been around in one of the rooms for a while and have made yourself known, you’ve got a good chance.  These are all general guidelines, rather than hard limits. We understand that there are cases of users who have little apparent activity who can be excellent at moderation; we’re also aware that the converse is true. Take note of what’s mentioned here, but also remember that requests are judged on a case-by-case basis.For ModeratorsIf you’re a Stack Exchange network moderator, you’re automatically privileged in Charcoal HQ (and in SOCVR if you are a Stack Overflow moderator). You don’t need to be added to the explicit privilege lists, as your diamond also gives you privileges with SmokeDetector. We assume that moderators are, on the whole, pretty good at moderation.Standard of BehaviourStack Exchange has a Be Nice policy - if you’re not familiar with it, you should go and read it now.As a SmokeDetector user, we expect everyone to abide by that policy. We also extend that standard a little: we expect that you take a professional and constructive approach to moderation, and that you’re capable of getting along with the users and administrators of SmokeDetector. Remember - getting along is not the same as liking. Additionally, the chatrooms are a professional environment - we’re friendly, so laughing and joking within reason are fine, but keep it professional.Charcoal intends to create an environment where all humans are welcome and will be treated equally regardless of personal or physical attributes or lack thereof. You can be part of this by being mindful of how what you say may be construed by others.The unofficial standard is this:  If a system administrator ends up getting pinged more than once because you’re abusing the system or seriously bugging other users, your privileges are likely to be revoked.Exercise some common sense, bring your sense of humour, and we’ll all get along just fine.Breaches of any part of this policy should in the majority of cases be reported to a Charcoal team member or by emailing smokey@artofcode.co.uk. In cases where a breach also contravenes the Stack Exchange Be Nice policy, it can be reported to any Stack Exchange network moderator.External LiaisonOccasionally, spam on SE sites gets handled incorrectly. Historically in these cases, a Charcoal member has often reached out to the people involved in this situation to offer advice on how spam should be handled correctly. However, as Charcoal has continued to expand, it has become more difficult to have experienced team members do this, so this is some guidance on how to approach liaising with other people or communities around the SE network.If you’re going to go to other sites and advise people on how to deal with spam, that’s awesome, but make sure you’re doing it diplomatically. Bear in mind that you will likely have little activity on the target site, and this is the first impression many users will have of you and of Charcoal.  Consider necessity. It’s good to give advice, but don’t get over-invested. Remember that one mishandled spam post isn’t a disaster, and won’t bring a site to its knees.  Provide context. Make sure you tell your audience who you are (and if pertinent, who Charcoal are and what we do), what happened with the spam post, why that wasn’t the right outcome, and what could be done instead. Wherever you can, provide links to back up your statements so that it’s not just “some random person from outer space somewhere else on the network”.  Phrase what you say carefully. Avoid anything that could seem accusatory - it seems silly, but try to avoid saying you. If it seems personal, someone’ll take it personally, and won’t be able to see the real issue because they think they’ve been insulted. Instead of “You did X and you shouldn’t have!”, try “X happened to Y post, and I think this could have been done Z way instead, according to [SE policy](link to it)“. Talk about actions or posts rather than users or people.  Assume good faith. Even if a post has been handled incorrectly, it most likely wasn’t done out of malice. Remember that, and don’t treat people like they’re idiots for not knowing the policy.Remember to Be Nice at all times. If at any point you don’t feel you can start or continue a conversation diplomatically and Nicely, step back. There are plenty of other users who can help out; if necessary, call on one of the mods involved in the project - they’re used to being diplomatic with irksome users.",

The facility is described in brief on the Autoflagging wiki page.PrerequisitesBefore running through the rest of these instructions, ensure that:  You have an account on metasmoke. You can get one of those here, if you don’t have one.  Your metasmoke account has the “flagger” permission. You can check that here: find your username, and look for the “flagger” role. Ask an admin about this if you don’t have it.  Autoflagging and registrations are enabled. You can check these under system settings; verify that the flagging_enabled and registration_enabled settings have a value of 1.  Your metasmoke account is write-access authenticated. If you don’t know whether it is or not, it’s probably not - visit the authentication status page to authenticate.Set Up Autoflagging  Enable flags on your account.Visit your preferences page, and read through the red-boxed disclaimer. If you’re happy with that, tick the box to enable flags on your account.  Set up preferences.On the same preferences page, click “Set up preferences” near the bottom of the page. The page you’re taken to lets you set up your preferences, which govern how many of your flags the system can use on any particular site or group of sites. Fill in the maximum number you’d like to allocate, select the sites you want that number to apply to, and click Save. You can repeat this process to have different maxima for different groups of sites.  Set up conditions.Visit the flag conditions setup page. This page lets you set up combinations of conditions governing how certain you want the system to be that a post is spam before using your account to flag it. The minimum weight controls the minimum cumulative weight of all the reasons a post was caught by (the maximum weight a reason can have is 100; we suggest 280 is a good value for this field). The maximum poster rep controls the most reputation a post author can have. The minimum reason count controls how many reasons you want a post to have been caught by - this performs a similar function to minimum weight. Fill in some values, and click Save. Again, you can repeat this process to have different accuracies for different groups of sites.  N.B. There’s a threshold of accuracy that all flagging conditions must meet before they’re used to cast flags automatically. Currently, this is 99.9% - if you want to get the current value of this threshold, it’s stored as the min_accuracy system setting. You can use the Preview button during condition setup to find out how accurate your proposed parameters are.At this point, you should be set up and your account will be used to cast spam flags according to the parameters you’ve specified.

            "title": "Autoflagging",
            "content": "Autoflagging  What is autoflagging?  Autoflagging is a project to enable us to flag Stack Exchange posts as spam automatically, based on data we’ve previously collected through SmokeDetector and metasmoke.  It’s built into the existing system - SmokeDetector sends the same data to metasmoke as it always has, and metasmoke performs some automated analysis of the post it’s just received to determine if it should cast spam flags or not.  But that’s dangerous!  Powerful, yes. Dangerous, less so. In designing the flagging system, we’ve thought through the concerns about doing this and addressed them where necessary.      Concern: System unilaterally nukes a post that wasn’t spamMitigation: We limit the maximum number of flags the system is allowed to cast on a single post. Additionally, false positives are rare.    Concern: System is faulty/flags things it shouldn’t/otherwise goes wrongMitigation: Users with SmokeDetector privileges have access to a command that immediately halts all flagging activity, and requires administrator intervention to reactivate.    Concern: System is inaccurate, with a high number of false positivesMitigation: We make use of past categorised data to select accurate capture reasons, and only flag based on accurate combinations.    But what about privacy?  There are some privacy concerns with this system. The major one of those is about API write tokens: to be able to cast flags, we need a write token for the Stack Exchange API, which needs to be stored somewhere within metasmoke. This means that whoever hosts metasmoke has access to those tokens, and could use them to carry out any action on the token owner’s account.  We deal with this by having clear, prominent disclaimers on metasmoke where any privacy issues are raised. These disclaimers detail exactly what a user is signing up for when clicking a link or button, and what privacy concerns there are. It is then left up to the user to make their own judgement about whether to trust the host.  The other concern is making sure users are aware that autoflags aren’t a get-out-of-jail-free card: flags cast on a Stack Exchange account are the responsiblity of the account holder, whether they were cast by an automated system or not, and bad flagging may result in moderators getting involved. This is partially mitigated by mandating accuracy in the system - while users are given some leeway to what the system can flag with their account, a 99.5% accuracy ratio over a sample of 1000 posts is mandatory. There is also another disclaimer used to detail the relevant concerns before users sign up for autoflagging.  Is it any good?  Yep. As mentioned previously, users are given some leeway to choose how accurate they want autoflags cast using their account to be, but all autoflags must be cast under a policy that is at least 99.5% accurate over a sample of 1000 posts. The suggested flag policy (also known as a flag condition) has an accuracy of 99.98%.  How does it work?  Warning: this bit is technical.  The basic design of the system hasn’t changed. SmokeDetector sends data about posts it thinks are spam to metasmoke. This data includes data about the post itself, and data about why the post was detected. We call the latter “reasons” - we have a reason that catches bad keywords, a reason for known spam websites, and reasons for other common characteristics of spam.  Users can provide feedback to SmokeDetector, either by replying to the bot in chat, or through review on metasmoke. All feedback eventually ends up attached to the relevant post in metasmoke’s database. We use this feedback to keep track of how accurate each reason is, and then assign a weight to each reason which is equal to its percentage accuracy to the nearest integer.  When users sign up for autoflagging, they are asked to create conditions that govern which posts their account can flag. This is done in terms of a minimum total reason weight, a maximum author reputation, and a minimum number of reasons. These are checked against the database of posts and feedback to work out how accurate the condition is, which is how we ensure conditions are at least 99.9% accurate.  When a post is sent to metasmoke, the system works out if any conditions allow it to flag the post. If they do, the condition owner’s account is used to cast a spam flag, and this process is repeated until the post reaches a maximum number of flags cast.",

To find out more, go to [Autoflagging](/flagging).{: .alert.link}[Charcoal](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540) are the people behind [SmokeDetector](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector), a community bot to detect spam on the [Stack Exchange network](http://stackexchange.com).## What is SmokeDetector? {#whats-smokey}SmokeDetector is a headless chatbot, written in Python, that scans all new and updated content across the Stack Exchange network to try to detect spam. And by 'everything', we mean 'everything' - that's every new post, on every SE site, plus every edit and other update. If it appears on the Stack Exchange-wide [real-time page](http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime), Smokey has seen it. That's about 100,000 posts scanned every day. Also, the bot is pretty accurate these days - some of the reasons that trip our filters have an accuracy of over 99%.It's administered and developed by the [team of people](/people) you can find in [Charcoal HQ](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540), our co-ordination chatroom. That's also where the posts that Smokey thinks are spam get reported to.**Fact:** If you wrote all our spam tests out vertically at point size 36, they'd be as tall as the [One World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center).## How does it work? {#technical-details}*Warning: technical programming details ahead.*SmokeDetector sets up a websocket connection to the same feed that powers the [Stack Exchange realtime page](http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=realtime). This websocket provides us with the feed of posts to scan.Every time a post comes in, we grab the full details of the post from the [Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs). Requests are bundled up wherever possible to save on our 10,000 requests per day API quota. Once we have the details, including the full text of the body, we run the post's body, title, and owner's username through [a whole load of tests](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/findspam.py), including several miles of regex (not literally) to determine whether or not the post is spam.If we determine that the post is spam, we post a report of that fact to Charcoal HQ (and to some other chatrooms, based on certain conditions). This report is the cue for some humans to go and look at the post, check if it's spam, and flag it if so. This gets spam posts destroyed quickly. Those humans can then feed back to SmokeDetector to say whether the report was correct or not. We store this feedback in our web dashboard, [metasmoke](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com), which is itself complex enough that it's a story for another day.## Want to get involved? {#get-involved}Anybody is welcome to get involved; the best way to do this is to drop into [Charcoal HQ](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540) and observe. Get yourself familiar with what goes on there; chat to some of the regulars about the system, and you'll figure out how to get involved.Eventually, when you're familiar with the system, you'll need to ask to be added to the privilege whitelist so that you can interact with SmokeDetector. There's a [wiki page](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Privileges) about that you should read before you ask; it'll give you some guidance about what we need from you and what you need to do.## For developers {#for-devs}If you're interested in integrating with the SmokeDetector system, we have an [API](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke/wiki/API-Documentation) that you can use to get stats about the system and to perform a limited set of write operations.
