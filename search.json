      "content": "Autoflagging\n\n\n  What is autoflagging?\n\n  Autoflagging is a project to enable us to flag Stack Exchange posts as spam automatically, based on data we’ve previously collected through SmokeDetector and metasmoke.\n\n  It’s built into the existing system - SmokeDetector sends the same data to metasmoke as it always has, and metasmoke performs some automated analysis of the post it’s just received to determine if it should cast spam flags or not.\n\n\n  But that’s dangerous!\n\n  Powerful, yes. Dangerous, less so. In designing the flagging system, we’ve thought through the concerns about doing this and addressed them where necessary.\n\n  \n    Concern: System unilaterally nukes a post that wasn’t spam\nMitigation: We limit the maximum number of flags the system is allowed to cast on a single post. Additionally, false positives are rare.\n    Concern: System is faulty/flags things it shouldn’t/otherwise goes wrong\nMitigation: Users with SmokeDetector privileges have access to a command that immediately halts all flagging activity, and requires administrator intervention to reactivate.\n    Concern: System is inaccurate, with a high number of false positives\nMitigation: We make use of past categorised data to select accurate capture reasons, and only flag based on accurate combinations.\n  \n\n\n  But what about privacy?\n\n  There are some privacy concerns with this system. The major one of those is about API write tokens: to be able to cast flags, we need a write token for the Stack Exchange API, which needs to be stored somewhere within metasmoke. This means that whoever hosts metasmoke has access to those tokens, and could use them to carry out any action on the token owner’s account.\n\n  We deal with this by having clear, prominent disclaimers on metasmoke where any privacy issues are raised. These disclaimers detail exactly what a user is signing up for when clicking a link or button, and what privacy concerns there are. It is then left up to the user to make their own judgement about whether to trust the host.\n\n  The other concern is making sure users are aware that autoflags aren’t a get-out-of-jail-free card: flags cast on a Stack Exchange account are the responsiblity of the account holder, whether they were cast by an automated system or not, and bad flagging may result in moderators getting involved. This is partially mitigated by mandating accuracy in the system - while users are given some leeway to what the system can flag with their account, a 99.5% accuracy ratio over a sample of 1000 posts is mandatory. There is also another disclaimer used to detail the relevant concerns before users sign up for autoflagging.\n\n\n  Is it any good?\n\n  Yep. As mentioned previously, users are given some leeway to choose how accurate they want autoflags cast using their account to be, but all autoflags must be cast under a policy that is at least 99.5% accurate over a sample of 1000 posts. The suggested flag policy (also known as a flag condition) has an accuracy of 99.98%.\n\n\n  How does it work?\n\n  Warning: this bit is technical.\n\n  The basic design of the system hasn’t changed. SmokeDetector sends data about posts it thinks are spam to metasmoke. This data includes data about the post itself, and data about why the post was detected. We call the latter “reasons” - we have a reason that catches bad keywords, a reason for known spam websites, and reasons for other common characteristics of spam.\n\n  Users can provide feedback to SmokeDetector, either by replying to the bot in chat, or through review on metasmoke. All feedback eventually ends up attached to the relevant post in metasmoke’s database. We use this feedback to keep track of how accurate each reason is, and then assign a weight to each reason which is equal to its percentage accuracy to the nearest integer.\n\n  When users sign up for autoflagging, they are asked to create conditions that govern which posts their account can flag. This is done in terms of a minimum total reason weight, a maximum author reputation, and a minimum number of reasons. These are checked against the database of posts and feedback to work out how accurate the condition is, which is how we ensure conditions are at least 99.9% accurate.\n\n  When a post is sent to metasmoke, the system works out if any conditions allow it to flag the post. If they do, the condition owner’s account is used to cast a spam flag, and this process is repeated until the post reaches a maximum number of flags cast.\n\n",

      "content": "we are charcoal\n\n\n  Autoflagging\n\n  Charcoal are currently running an autoflagging initiative, to flag spam posts automatically based on past collected data. To find out more, go to Autoflagging.\n\n\nCharcoal are the people behind SmokeDetector, a community bot to detect spam on the Stack Exchange network.\n\n\n  What is SmokeDetector?\n\n  SmokeDetector is a headless chatbot, written in Python, that scans all new and updated content across the Stack Exchange network to try to detect spam. And by ‘everything’, we mean ‘everything’ - that’s every new post, on every SE site, plus every edit and other update. If it appears on the Stack Exchange-wide real-time page, Smokey has seen it. That’s about 100,000 posts scanned every day. Also, the bot is pretty accurate these days - some of the reasons that trip our filters have an accuracy of over 99%.\n\n  It’s administered and developed by the team of people you can find in Charcoal HQ, our co-ordination chatroom. That’s also where the posts that Smokey thinks are spam get reported to.\n\n  Fact: If you wrote all our spam tests out vertically at point size 36, they’d be as tall as the One World Trade Center.\n\n\n  How does it work?\n\n  Warning: technical programming details ahead.\n\n  SmokeDetector sets up a websocket connection to the same feed that powers the Stack Exchange realtime page. This websocket provides us with the feed of posts to scan.\n\n  Every time a post comes in, we grab the full details of the post from the Stack Exchange API. Requests are bundled up wherever possible to save on our 10,000 requests per day API quota. Once we have the details, including the full text of the body, we run the post’s body, title, and owner’s username through a whole load of tests, including several miles of regex (not literally) to determine whether or not the post is spam.\n\n  If we determine that the post is spam, we post a report of that fact to Charcoal HQ (and to some other chatrooms, based on certain conditions). This report is the cue for some humans to go and look at the post, check if it’s spam, and flag it if so. This gets spam posts destroyed quickly. Those humans can then feed back to SmokeDetector to say whether the report was correct or not. We store this feedback in our web dashboard, metasmoke, which is itself complex enough that it’s a story for another day.\n\n\n  Want to get involved?\n\n  Anybody is welcome to get involved; the best way to do this is to drop into Charcoal HQ and observe. Get yourself familiar with what goes on there; chat to some of the regulars about the system, and you’ll figure out how to get involved.\n\n  Eventually, when you’re familiar with the system, you’ll need to ask to be added to the privilege whitelist so that you can interact with SmokeDetector. There’s a wiki page about that you should read before you ask; it’ll give you some guidance about what we need from you and what you need to do.\n\n\n  For developers\n\n  If you’re interested in integrating with the SmokeDetector system, we have an API that you can use to get stats about the system and to perform a limited set of write operations. Again, drop into chat for more information, or the docs are all available in the metasmoke wiki.\n\n",

Welcome to the one-stop shop for all your answers when it comes to getting in contact with the right people.\n\n  I have a question about how to use SmokeDetector/metasmoke/FDSC\n\n  Just ask in Charcoal HQ! There are always lots of regulars there willing to answer your questions. We also have a wiki for SmokeDetector, and instructions for FDSC which will answer many of your questions for you.\n\n\n  I have a feature request for SmokeDetector/metasmoke/FDSC\n\n  First, put your idea out the folks in Charcoal HQ. If there seems to be a general consensus that it is a good idea, make an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository so that it is easier to track and makes it harder to forget about it.\n\n\n  I’d like to contact the SmokeDetector maintainers\n\n  Ping whichever of the following people happen to be in the room at the moment: Undo, ArtOfCode, angussidney, Thomas Ward, hichris123, Andy, ferrybig.\n\n\n  I’d like to contact the metasmoke maintainers\n\n  Ping ArtOfCode or Undo, they do most of the development on metasmoke.\n\n\n  I’d like to contact the FDSC maintainers\n\n  Ping one of the authors of the userscript, ArtOfCode or angussidney.\n\n\n  I’d like to contact the author of another one of your userscripts\n\n  Look in the source code of the userscript on GitHub, the author’s name can be found in the metablock at the top of the file.\n\n\n  It’s dead Jim!\n\n  First of all, check that Smokey isn’t responding to any commands. You can also try rebooting Smokey from either SOCVR or Tavern on the Meta, more often than not Smokey has just lost connection to CHQ. If all else fails, please ping one of the people with a bold name on this list, they will be able to start a backup instance of SmokeDetector.\n\n\n  Someone is being disruptive in Charcoal HQ, who can sort the situation out?\n\n  Ping one of the Room Owners, they will calm down the situation and take further action if necessary. If someone has violated SE’s Be Nice policy, you can contact any diamond Moderator.\n\n\n  I’d like to be added to the privilege whitelist for SmokeDetector\n\n  Make sure that you’ve read the Privileges and Feedback Guidance pages, then ping one of the SmokeDetector maintainers and they will evaluate your request.\n\n\n  I’d like to get further privileges (autoflagging, code access etc), who do I ask?\n\n  Please ping an admin: Undo, ArtOfCode, hichris123, angussidney, or Andy.\n\n\n  I have a userscript which is useful to the regulars of Charcoal HQ, and I’d like to get it included in the Userscripts repository. How can I get that to happen?\n\n  Ping Undo, ArtOfCode or angussidney, and they will give you push access to the repository to add your US. While you are waiting, you can make a pull request to add the userscript to the repo. Don’t forget to leave a message in CHQ to let people know about it!\n\n\n  There’s some other code that I’d like to contribute, who can I talk to to get it included?\n\n  Just make a pull request to one of our repositories on GitHub, and one of the maintainers will review your code and merge it in. Note that some projects have Continuous Integration (CI) tests that needs to be passed before that can happen.\n\n\n  I need to discuss something with the admins privately, how can I contact them?\n\n  Please email smokey@charcoal-se.org, and it will reach the right people.\n\n\n\n\n",

Do this at your own risk.\n\nYou can use the `per_page` query string parameter to adjust how many results you get, up to a maximum of 100.\n\nThe `has_more` field in the response indicates if there are more results available than have been returned in this result set; use the `page` query string parameter to get the next page of results. `?page=1` will return the first page; `?page=2` the second, and so on.\n\n### Example\n**Request:**\n\n    GET /api/posts/between?from_date=1477404348&to_date=1477490748 HTTP/1.1\n\n**Response:**\n\n    {\n        \"items\":[\n            {\n                \"id\":44810,\n                \"title\":\"HL12 Diabetes is a characteristic equation\",\n                \"body\":\"\",\n                \"link\":\"//drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/218904\",\n                \"post_creation_date\":null,\n                \"created_at\":\"2016-10-26T14:03:44.000Z\",\n                \"updated_at\":\"2016-10-26T14:04:06.000Z\",\n                \"site_id\":86,\n                \"user_link\":\"//drupal.stackexchange.com/u/68737\",\n                \"username\":\"Kathleenpochi\",\n                \"why\":\"Body - Position 277-293: weight reduction\\nBody - Position 375-394: supplementsoffer.co, Position 616-635: supplementsoffer.co\\nPost - Link at end: http://www.supplementsoffer.com/hl12-diabetes/\\u003c/a\\u003e\",\n                \"user_reputation\":1,\n                \"score\":null,\n                \"upvote_count\":null,\n                \"downvote_count\":null,\n                \"stack_exchange_user_id\":37865,\n                \"is_tp\":true,\n                \"is_fp\":false,\n                \"is_naa\":false\n            },\n            {\n                \"id\":44809,\n                \"title\":\"Best site for git commands line beginning.

Replace `:ids` in the URL with a semicolon-delimited list of metasmoke reason IDs (which can be found on the metasmoke dashboard - look in the link to each reason), and all database fields on each reason will be returned.\n\nYou can use the `per_page` query string parameter to adjust how many results you get, up to a maximum of 100.\n\nThe `has_more` field in the response indicates if there are more results available than have been returned in this result set; use the `page` query string parameter to get the next page of results. `?page=1` will return the first page; `?page=2` the second, and so on.\n\n### Example\n**Request:**\n\n    HTTP/1.1 GET /api/reasons/47;67\n\n**Response:**\n\n    {\n        \"items\":[\n            {\n                \"id\":47,\n                \"reason_name\":\"Phone number detected in title\",\n                \"last_post_title\":\"1.8.0.0. .8.4.1. 6.4.3.6.

      "content": "# State of the Project\n\nWe are looking into automating flags from Smokey.  Basically, it will look as if though Smokey clicks \"flag\" → \"spam\" as soon as Smoke Detector reports a post (though not all reported posts are eligible; see the Spam weight section for details.).\n\nWe are working out the specifics of the system right now, so the details are still in flux.\n\nTo participate in the development of this feature, please show up in [the Charcoal HQ chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq) and wait for a good moment to bring up your topic (afternoon UTC seems to be a fairly busy time in the room).\n\nThe main dashboard (status, statistics, etc) is at https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging\n\n# Technical details and spam weight\n\nEvery time a post is reported, it triggers a [variety of different reasons](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/dashboard) for being reported (such as bad keyword, blacklisted website, etc). Each of these reasons (also known as \"heuristics\") contributes to the post's weight. The formula that determines how much weight each reason contributes is as follows:\n\n```\n[Number of True Positives caught by reason] / [Total posts caught by the reason] * 100\n```\n\nIn our current preliminary testing, the threshold that was set for posts to be flagged automatically is at a weight of 280. In our database of over 50,000 records, this score threshold has a predictive accuracy of 99.98% (meaning of all posts hitting 280 score caught by Smokey, 99.98% were true positives).\n\nAs with any other projection, you need to understand that past performance is no guarantee for the future.\n\nThe flagging is done by Metasmoke (the back end component) using the credentials of users who have signed up to allow the system to cast flags on their behalf.\n\n# Opting In\n\nThere is a separate page about [Setting up Autoflagging](Set-Up-Autoflagging).  This brief section is a quick FAQ-like summary.\n\nThere is a \"big red button\" which you can click.  Please be patient and try again until it actually sticks!  This is a known issue which of course we hope to resolve eventually.\n\nOnce [your flagging status](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/preferences) shows as active (the button stays checked if you navigate away from the page and come back again) and your conditions are met, you are eligible to be drawn randomly when a flag is about to be raised.  This is a random selection out of the list of users whose conditions allow flagging at the given weight on the given site.\n\nYou can review the flags cast on your behalf at a URL like `https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/users/XX/logs` (for example, [Undo's log](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/users/1/logs)).  There is a number of other useful links on the personal flagging dashboard where you can tweak conditions or turn off autoflagging.",

To test specifically, use `!!/test-a` for answer, `!!/test-q` for question body, `!!/test-t` for title, or `!!/test-u` for username.\n - `!!/isblu`, `!!/iswlu` - Checks if a user is blacklisted/whitelisted. Two formats are accepted: `` or ` `\n - `!!/whoami` - Replies with the bot's user id for that site\n - `!!/amiprivileged` - Lets you know if you are in the list of privileged users\n - `!!/amicodeprivileged` - Lets you know whether or not you have code privileges (i.e. you can blacklist without approval)\n - `!!/notify  ` - Tells SmokeDetector to ping you, in the given chatroom, when a post is reported on the given site.  \n  Example:  `!!/notify 89 parenting.stackexchange.com-`  \n  Note: Please use the squelch suffix (`-`) and avoid spamming the chat room with too many requests. See [this chat message](http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/4157790#4157790) and the surrounding context.\n - `!!/unnotify  ` - Cancels the previously set notification.

If you need to see older data, it can be found in the post record on Metasmoke.\n- `autoflagged` - Returns if the post was autoflagged or not, and if so, what users were used.\n\n# Privileged commands\n\nThese commands require privileges.\n\n\n - `!!/report  [ [...]]` - Makes SmokeDetector report a specific post/multiple specific posts in Charcoal HQ and Tavern on the Meta. The originator of each post will be added to the blacklist. Maximally 5 at a time.\n - `!!/allspam ` - To be used if a spammer has many posts so you don't have to use `!!/report`. This command posts a message about the user in all applicable rooms.  Note that this command does NOT auto-TPU anything, for various reasons. It has an alias, `!!/reportuser `\n - `!!/blacklist ` - **This command is deprecated.** Use one of the three specialized blacklist commands instead, which are shown below. If run, this command will print a help \n - `!!/blacklist-website ` - Adds a regular expression pattern to the [website blacklist](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/blacklisted_websites.txt). Make sure regex special characters are escaped (in particular `.` characters should be escaped as `\\.`). If you are a code admin on metasmoke, your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes so that they can be reviewed.\n - `!!/blacklist-keyword ` - Adds a regular expression pattern to the [list of bad keywords](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/bad_keywords.txt). Just like `!!/blacklist-website`, if you are a code admin on metasmoke your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes to that they can be reviewed.\n - `!!/blacklist-username ` - Adds a regular expression pattern to the [username blacklist](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/blacklisted_usernames.txt). Just like `!!/blacklist-website` and `!!/blacklist-keyword`, if you are a code admin on metasmoke your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes to that they can be reviewed.\n - `!!/addwlu ` or `!!/addwlu  ` - Adds a user to the whitelist (this means that if the username for that user matches one of the regexes, this will be ignored).\n - `!!/rmwlu ` or `!!/rmwlu  ` - Removes a user from the whitelist.\n - `!!/addblu` (same syntax as `!!/addwlu`) - Adds a user to the blacklist (this means that any post of this user will be reported).\n - `!!/rmblu` (same syntax as `!!/rmwlu`) - Removes a user from the blacklist.\n - `!!/reboot` - Reboots SmokeDetector.\n - `!!/stappit` - Stops all SmokeDetector instances.\n - `!!/stappit ` - Stops all SmokeDetector instances where `string` is included in the location (e.g. `!!/stappit undo` would stop `Undo/EC2` and `Undo/DO`, but not `teward/aroura`\n - `!!/pull` - Pulls new revisions from GitHub.\n - `!!/master` - When SmokeDetector enters reverted mode, use this command to go back to the `master` branch.\n - `!!/errorlogs ` - Shows the last *N* lines of the error logs.\n - `!!/block ` - Blocks SmokeDetector globally for *N* seconds; no alerts will be posted. Example: `!!/block 600` blocks globally for 10 minutes.\n - `!!/block  ` - Blocks SmokeDetector in the specific room for *N* seconds; no alerts will be posted there. Example: `!!/block 3600 89` blocks alerts in the Tavern for one hour.\n - `!!/unblock` - Unblock SmokeDetector manually, resetting global block only.\n - `!!/unblock ` - Unblock SmokeDetector manually in the specific room.\n\n\n# Privileged commands as reply\n\nThese commands require privileges, and have to be posted as a reply to a message of SmokeDetector.\n\nUser-friendly syntax: \n\n- use `spam` or `rude` or `abusive` or `offensive` for posts that should be flagged as such (equivalent to `tpu-`; see below)\n- use `v`, `vand` or `vandalism` for posts that have been vandalised and the vandalism edit should be rolled back (equivalent to `tp-`)\n- use `notspam` if the post should not be flagged (equivalent to `fp-`)\n\nComplete list:\n\n - `tp` or `true` - Marks a reported post as true positive.\n - `tpu` or `trueu` - Marks a reported post as true positive and adds the poster to the blacklist.\n - `fp` or `false` - Marks a reported post as false positive. Additionally removes the user from the blacklist, if that was the reason that the post was reported.\n - `fpu` or `falseu` - Marks a reported post as false positive and adds the poster to the whitelist.\n - `naa` - If the reported post is an answer, this command records it as NAA (Not an answer) in metasmoke.\n - `ignore` - Makes SmokeDetector ignore a reported post.\n - `delete`, `del`, `remove` or `gone` - Deletes a message of SmokeDetector.\n - `postgone` - Edits out the post link of a SmokeDetector report.\n\n# Silent mode and aliases\n\nIf you don't want SmokeDetector to reply when executing a command, add a `-` sign at the end, for example `fp-`. This is a good practice to cut down on chatroom clutter.  Note that SmokeDetector will always report any errors, even if the `-` is present. The hyphen can be placed after the command itself, or after its parameter. The following commands support silent mode: replying to spam reports, managing black- and white-list, and managing chat notifications.\n\nAlso, some frequently used commands have one-letter aliases, or convenient words that can be used instead:\n\n\nCommandAlias of\nffp-\nnotspamfp-\nktpu-\nspamtpu-\nrudetpu-\nabusetpu-\nabusivetpu-\noffensivetpu-\nvandalismtp-\nnnaa-\n\n\n# Message deletion\nMessages by SmokeDetector can be deleted within 2 minutes after they were posted by using the `del`, `remove`, or `gone` commands. After 2 minutes are up, SmokeDetector cannot delete its own messages in response to those commands, so any deletion after that window must be done by a moderator.\n\nMessages will also be deleted in Tavern on the Meta and SO Close Vote Reviewers if the relevant post is deleted before the 2-minute window is up; this does not apply in Charcoal HQ.\n\nMessages will also be deleted in Tavern on the Meta and SO Close Vote Reviewers if they are fed back on as a false positive within the 2-minute window.\n\n# Shortcut commands\n\nYou can now use a shortcut to post a reply to one, two or three messages\nat the same time, in this shape:\n\n    sd cmd1\n    sd cmd1 cmd2\n    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3\n    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4\n    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4 cmd5\n\ncmd1 will be invoked in the most recent message, cmd2 on the message\nbefore that and cmd3 on the message before that, and so on.\n\nIt's also possible to skip a message. Replace a command by a - to skip a\nmessage. For example, `sd - delete` skips the most recent message and\ndeletes the message before that one.\n\nSmokey will reply to your shortcut command, unless all commands have quiet\nmode (like tp-) or just don't reply by default (like delete).\n\nA few examples:\n\n- `sd - delete` keeps the most recent message and deletes the one before that.\n- `sd tp fp delete` marks the most recent message as tp, the one before that as fp, and deletes the one before that.\n\nYou can also put a digit in front of a command so the command will apply as many times as the digit. A few examples:\n\n- `sd 2tpu` == `sd tpu tpu`\n- `sd 2tpu 3fpu` == `sd tpu tpu fpu fpu fpu`\n- `sd 2- fp` == `sd - - fp`",

This includes regex-based pattern checks, blacklists, and check methods. Use the various `!!/test` commands to check this.\n - Is it something *we want to catch*? Remember that Smokey is designed to catch spam and/or abuse - anything else (low quality posts, not-an-answers, etc) is out of scope. There are plenty more moderation bots around the network that might want that kind of check, though.\n\n## 2. Write a Check\n...preferably addressed to me, with plenty of money involved. (Ha! Spelling jokes!)\n\nIf you've determined that a new check is necessary, now you need to actually write it. The preferred way of doing this is a regex - these are (usually) simpler and easier to maintain than the alternatives. Writing a regex check is pretty easy: just write the regex. You can use regex-checking websites like [regex101](http://regex101.com) to check if you've written it right - doing this is encouraged, because regex is not an easy language to speak.\n\nThe alternative, which should only be used if a regex doesn't do the job, is to write a check method. This is done by writing a new method in `findspam.py`, which takes two parameters: `s` and `site`. `s` is a string of stuff that you need to check (like the title, username, or post body), and `site` is the site that the post is on. Give your method a descriptive name, so that its purpose can be judged at a glance.\n\nYour method should return a pair of values. The first is a boolean, indicating whether or not you think the post is spam. The second is a string, which is the `why` data for the post (and if you don't know what that means, you should probably be letting someone more experienced write the check - or go learn about it).\n\nHere's an example check method. This method will say that any `s` longer than 3 characters is spam.\n\n    def ridiculous_spam_check(s, site):\n        if len(s) > 3:\n            return True, \"Length is greater than 3 characters\"\n        else:\n            return False, \"\"\n\n## 3. Endless Lists\nChecks are our ammunition against spam; now you need a gun to fire it from. In our case, it's a GLOCK - a Giant List of Checks and Keywords.\n\nScroll to the `rules` array, which is [somewhere around line 312 in `findspam.py`](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/findspam.py#L312). This structure describes all the checks that SmokeDetector runs, and how to apply them. (N.B.: It's not actually JSON, don't make that mistake - it's Python dicts.)\n\nYou need to add a new entry to this array that describes your check. The general format of this dictionary is:\n\n    {\n        'regex': r\"Include your regex here if it's a regex-based check\",\n        'method': method_name,  # Pass the name of your method here if it's a method-based check,\n        'all': True,  # True if you want to scan all sites in the network, False otherwise,\n        'sites': [],  # If `all` is true, these sites are excluded; otherwise, they are the only sites to get scanned\n        'reason': \"Name of the reason you're categorising these posts as (bad keyword, link at end of body, etc)\",\n        'title': False,  # True if you want to scan post titles, False otherwise\n        'body': True,  # True if you want to scan post bodies, False otherwise\n        'username': False,  # True if you want to scan owner usernames, False otherwise\n        'body_summary': False,  # True if you want to scan body summaries, False otherwise\n        'stripcodeblocks': False,  # True if you want code removed before getting passed to your check\n        'max_rep': 20,  # Posts from users above this reputation will not be scanned\n        'max_score': 1,  # Posts scoring above this value will not be scanned\n    }\n\nYou should only include *one* of `regex` or `method` - checks should not be both at the same time.",

      "title": "Feedback Guidance",
      "content": "Some aspects of feedback to SmokeDetector have historically caused confusion. This page is intended to address some of those confusions.\n\n### Generic Guidance\nIn very general terms, the litmus test for whether you should use [`k`](Commands#silent-mode-and-aliases) or [`f`](Commands#silent-mode-and-aliases) is this:\n\n> If SmokeDetector was implemented as a system-level block, would we want to catch this type of activity?\n\nIf the answer to that question is *yes*, you should mark the post `k`. There are a few types of activity we have specific guidelines for, as outlined below.\n\n### Disclosed affiliation\nIt's fine to promote your own product or service on Stack Exchange, *as long as*:\n\n- you're not doing it excessively\n- you disclose your affiliation\n- you only do so where relevant\n\nIf all of those conditions are true, then self-promotion is not spam and therefore `f` and not `k` (unless it doesn't answer the question, in which case it's `n`). If any of them are false, self-promotion is `k`.\n\n### Self-vandalism\nSelf-vandalism is where a user vandalises their own post by replacing all its useful content with something like \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\", or \"deleted deleted deleted\". For self-vandalism, use [`tp-`](Commands#privileged-commands-as-reply) (or one of its aliases, such as `v`, `vand` or `vandalism`). At a system level, we'd want to catch and block people doing this, but it's not worth blacklisting the user because it's usually a one-time incident. Most users, when warned, don't do it again.\n\n### Foreign-language posts on English sites (or vice versa)\nTreat these as you would an English post. If it's spam, offensive, etc., then mark it as `k`; otherwise use `f` or `n`. Particularly, answers in the wrong language for the target site are NAA, so `n`. Being in the wrong language for the site *alone* doesn't make a post `k`-able.\n\n### Plagiarism\nPlagiarism - copying without attribution from another source such as someone else's answer or another website - is not always easy to spot. If you do spot it in an answer, then mark it as `k` - you may wish to explain to other users in the chatroom why you've done that, to avoid arguments about what the feedback should be.\n\nIf you get to a post before it's deleted, an easy way to spot plagiarism is to check the other posts on the same page for similar content.\n\nHowever, while plagiarism should be marked as `k`, the `!!/report` command shouldn't be used to report plagiarism - catching plagiarism is a bonus if we do, but we're not aiming to catch it.\n\n### NAA feedback\nNAA feedback has sometimes been a little confusing. Using `n` as your feedback should, in general, be done if:\n\n- the post is not spam, abusive, offensive etc. (use `k`)\n- you would flag the post as Not An Answer on the site itself",

      "title": "What the website blacklist does:",
      "content": "## What the website blacklist does:\n\nThe website blacklist is one of the filters used by the spam detection bot SmokeDetector. It consists of a list of websites associated with known spam that automatically raise suspicion when posted anywhere on Stack Exchange.\n\nBlacklisting a website makes SmokeDetector report every post that is posted or modified with a link to the website (formatted as a link or otherwise) in its text. The website blacklist is maintained in the [SmokeDetector GitHub repository](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector), specifically in the file [blacklisted_websites.txt](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/blacklisted_websites.txt).\n\n## When to blacklist a website:\n\nGenerally, it makes sense to blacklist a website if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n- Website has been used in **at least** 2 confirmed instances (tp fed back reports) of spam (You can use https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/search to find other instances of a website being used for spam).\n\n- Website is not used legitimately in other posts on Stack Exchange.\n\n- Website is not currently caught in either of these filters:\n\t- bad keyword in body\n\t- blacklisted website\n\t- pattern matching website\n\nYou can test this by using the **!!/test ** command. (or **!!/test-a ** to test as an answer).\n\n## How to blacklist a website:\n\nEveryone with SmokeDetector privileges (if you don't have those and would like them, read up on [how to get them](Privileges)) can blacklist a website, though the action will require admin-approval for most people. Additions to the blacklist (via both methods) must be valid regular expressions (regex). In reality that means for largely exact matches (like the website blacklist) that you ensure that special characters (like `.`) are escaped. (Example: `thisisspam\\.com`)\n\nThere are 2 methods to add a website to the blacklist:\n\n- Propose a change to the [blacklisted_websites.txt](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/blacklisted_websites.txt) file on GitHub and create a pull request specifying why you want to blacklist the website.\n\n- Use the \"!!/blacklist-website \" command in any of the Smoke Detector chatrooms. This will create a pull request containing your change for you.",

    "smokey-privileges-html": {
      "title": "Privileges",
      "content": "SmokeDetector operates a privilege system. That is, before you are able to use a number of commands (most notably the feedback commands), you must be added to a list of privileged users in SmokeDetector's code. \n\n## Getting Privileged\nIn theory, anyone can be added to the privilege list. In practice, this doesn't always work out, so *as a general guideline*, we look for a few things to indicate how qualified you are.\n\n- **Reputation**  \n  A higher reputation score indicates a higher level of participation on the sites, which is strongly correlated with moderation ability. We're looking for enough rep to indicate that you've been around a little while: generally, 300 on one site will suffice.\n\n- **Participation**  \n  We can also simply look through your various accounts on the network. SmokeDetector scans posts for spam network-wide, so the more sites you have accounts on, the better it is for everyone - more accounts means you can flag spam on more sites. We may also look at how active you've been on various sites (and on their meta sites) to determine how able you are to moderate content effectively. Again, we're not looking for a massive or exceptional record, just enough to show that you know what you're doing.\n\n- **Referral**  \n  If your request for privileges is supported by a regular of one of the [chat rooms](Chat-Rooms) that SmokeDetector posts reports to, we'll look more favourably upon it - we tend to trust people who are already part of the system to make sound judgements. Additionally, if you've been around in one of the rooms for a while and have made yourself known, you've got a good chance.\n\nThese are all general guidelines, rather than hard limits. We understand that there are cases of users who have little apparent activity who can be excellent at moderation; we're also aware that the converse is true. Take note of what's mentioned here, but also remember that requests are judged on a case-by-case basis.\n\n#### For Moderators\nIf you're a Stack Exchange network moderator, **you're automatically privileged** in [Charcoal HQ](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq) (and in [SOCVR](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers) if you are a Stack Overflow moderator). You don't need to be added to the explicit privilege lists, as your diamond also gives you privileges with SmokeDetector. We assume that moderators are, on the whole, pretty good at moderation.\n\n## Standard of Behaviour\nStack Exchange has a [Be Nice policy](http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice) - if you're not familiar with it, you should go and read it now.\n\nAs a SmokeDetector user, we expect everyone to abide by that policy. We also extend that standard a little: we expect that you take a professional and constructive approach to moderation, and that you're capable of getting along with the users and administrators of SmokeDetector. Remember - *getting along* is not the same as *liking*. Additionally, the chatrooms are a professional environment - we're friendly, so laughing and joking within reason are fine, but keep it professional.\n\nCharcoal intends to create an environment where all humans are welcome and will be treated equally regardless of personal or physical attributes or lack thereof. You can be part of this by being mindful of how what you say may be construed by others.\n\nThe [unofficial standard](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/29760077#29760077) is this:\n\n> If a system administrator ends up getting pinged more than once because you're abusing the system or seriously bugging other users, your privileges are likely to be revoked.\n\nExercise some common sense, bring your sense of humour, and we'll all get along just fine.\n\nBreaches of any part of this policy should in the majority of cases be reported to a [Charcoal team member](//charcoal-se.org/people) or by emailing `smokey@artofcode.co.uk`. In cases where a breach also contravenes the Stack Exchange Be Nice policy, it can be reported to any Stack Exchange network moderator.\n\n## External Liaison\nOccasionally, spam on SE sites gets handled incorrectly. Historically in these cases, a Charcoal member has often reached out to the people involved in this situation to offer advice on how spam should be handled correctly. However, as Charcoal has continued to expand, it has become more difficult to have experienced team members do this, so this is some guidance on how to approach liaising with other people or communities around the SE network.\n\n**If you're going to go to other sites and advise people on how to deal with spam**, that's awesome, but make sure you're doing it diplomatically. Bear in mind that you will likely have little activity on the target site, and this is the first impression many users will have of you and of Charcoal.\n\n- **Consider necessity.** It's good to give advice, but don't get over-invested. Remember that one mishandled spam post isn't a disaster, and won't bring a site to its knees.\n- **Provide context.** Make sure you tell your audience who *you* are (and if pertinent, who Charcoal are and what we do), what happened with the spam post, why that wasn't the right outcome, and what could be done instead. Wherever you can, provide links to back up your statements so that it's not just \"some random person from outer space somewhere else on the network\".\n- **Phrase what you say carefully.** Avoid anything that could seem accusatory - it seems silly, but try to avoid saying *you*. If it seems personal, someone'll take it personally, and won't be able to see the real issue because they think they've been insulted. Instead of *\"You did X and you shouldn't have!\"*, try *\"X happened to Y post, and* I think *this could have been done Z way instead, according to `[SE policy](link to it)`\"*. Talk about *actions* or *posts* rather than *users* or *people*.\n- **Assume good faith.** Even if a post has been handled incorrectly, it most likely wasn't done out of malice. Remember that, and don't treat people like they're idiots for not knowing the policy.\n\nRemember to [Be Nice](http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice) at all times. If *at any point* you don't feel you can start or continue a conversation diplomatically and Nicely, *step back*. There are plenty of other users who can help out; if necessary, call on one of the mods involved in the project - they're used to being diplomatic with irksome users.",

      "title": "Set Up Autoflagging",
      "content": "This document provides instructions on how to set up your account to cast automatic flags via the SmokeDetector/metasmoke system.  The facility is described in brief on the [Autoflagging](Autoflagging) wiki page.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore running through the rest of these instructions, ensure that:\n\n - You have an account on metasmoke. You can get one of those [here](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/users/sign_up), if you don't have one.\n - Your metasmoke account has the \"flagger\" permission. You can check that [here](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/users): find your username, and look for the \"flagger\" role. Ask an admin about this if you don't have it.\n - Autoflagging and registrations are enabled. You can check these under [system settings](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/settings); verify that the `flagging_enabled` and `registration_enabled` settings have a value of `1`.\n - Your metasmoke account is write-access authenticated. If you don't know whether it is or not, it's probably not - visit the [authentication status page](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/authentication/status) to authenticate.\n\n## Set Up Autoflagging\n1. **Enable flags on your account.**  \n   Visit [your preferences page](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/preferences), and read through the red-boxed disclaimer. If you're happy with that, tick the box to enable flags on your account.\n2. **Set up preferences.**  \n   On the same preferences page, click \"Set up preferences\" near the bottom of the page. The page you're taken to lets you set up your preferences, which govern how many of your flags the system can use on any particular site or group of sites. Fill in the maximum number you'd like to allocate, select the sites you want that number to apply to, and click Save. You can repeat this process to have different maxima for different groups of sites.\n3. **Set up conditions.**  \n   Visit the [flag conditions setup](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/flagging/conditions/new) page. This page lets you set up combinations of conditions governing how certain you want the system to be that a post is spam before using your account to flag it. The minimum weight controls the minimum cumulative weight of all the reasons a post was caught by (the maximum weight a reason can have is 100; we suggest 280 is a good value for this field). The maximum poster rep controls the most reputation a post author can have. The minimum reason count controls how many reasons you want a post to have been caught by - this performs a *similar* function to minimum weight. Fill in some values, and click Save. Again, you can repeat this process to have different accuracies for different groups of sites.\n\n> **N.B.** There's a threshold of accuracy that all flagging conditions must meet before they're used to cast flags automatically. Currently, this is 99.9% - if you want to get the current value of this threshold, it's stored as the `min_accuracy` system setting. You can use the Preview button during condition setup to find out how accurate your proposed parameters are.\n\nAt this point, you should be set up and your account will be used to cast spam flags according to the parameters you've specified. If you've found any bugs, or have feedback on the system, let us know. If you've found a security bug, please email it to someone rather than posting publicly.",
