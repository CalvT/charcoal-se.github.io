## Help! I've found a security bug!
Don't panic, they happen. If you've found a security issue in any Charcoal project, please don't post it publicly
(including in Charcoal HQ, our chatroom). Instead, email details of the vulnerability to 
[smokey@charcoal-se.org](mailto:smokey@charcoal-se.org), which is a mailing list that will reach the necessary people.
They'll have a look and confirm whether or not it's a security issue, and deal with it appropriately.
