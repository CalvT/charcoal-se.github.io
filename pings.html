      <h1 id="meta-who-to-ping">Meta: Who to ping</h1>

<p>When an organisation such as Charcoal is maintaining several large projects with may people involved, it can get confusing over who you should ping for help. Welcome to the one-stop shop for all your answers when it comes to getting in contact with the right people.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="question">I have a question about how to use SmokeDetector/metasmoke/FDSC</h2>

  <p>Just ask in <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq">Charcoal HQ</a>! There are always lots of regulars there willing to answer your questions. We also have a <a href="https://git.io/vXsZo">wiki</a> for SmokeDetector, and <a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/Userscripts/wiki/FDSC">instructions</a> for FDSC which will answer many of your questions for you.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="feature-request">I have a feature request for SmokeDetector/metasmoke/FDSC</h2>

  <p>First, put your idea out the folks in Charcoal HQ. If there seems to be a general consensus that it is a good idea, make an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository so that it is easier to track and makes it harder to forget about it.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="smokey-maintainers">I’d like to contact the SmokeDetector maintainers</h2>

  <p>Ping whichever of the following people happen to be in the room at the moment: Undo, ArtOfCode, angussidney, Thomas Ward, hichris123, Andy, ferrybig.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="ms-maintainers">I’d like to contact the metasmoke maintainers</h2>

  <p>Ping ArtOfCode or Undo, they do most of the development on metasmoke.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="fdsc-maintainers">I’d like to contact the FDSC maintainers</h2>

  <p>Ping one of the authors of the userscript, ArtOfCode or angussidney.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="userscripts">I’d like to contact the author of another one of your userscripts</h2>

  <p>Look in the source code of the userscript on GitHub, the author’s name can be found in the metablock at the top of the file.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="dead">It’s dead Jim!</h2>

  <p>First of all, check that Smokey isn’t responding to any commands. You can also try rebooting Smokey from either SOCVR or Tavern on the Meta, more often than not Smokey has just lost connection to CHQ. If all else fails, please ping one of the people with a <strong>bold name</strong> on <a href="/people.html">this list</a>, they will be able to start a backup instance of SmokeDetector.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="behavior">Someone is being disruptive in Charcoal HQ, who can sort the situation out?</h2>

  <p>Ping one of the <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/info/11540/charcoal-hq#room-ownercards">Room Owners</a>, they will calm down the situation and take further action if necessary. If someone has violated SE’s Be Nice policy, you can contact any diamond Moderator.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="privileges">I’d like to be added to the privilege whitelist for SmokeDetector</h2>

  <p>Make sure that you’ve read the <a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Privileges">Privileges</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/wiki/Feedback-Guidance">Feedback Guidance pages</a>, then ping one of the <a href="#smokey-maintainers">SmokeDetector maintainers</a> and they will evaluate your request.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="more-privileges">I’d like to get further privileges (autoflagging, code access etc), who do I ask?</h2>

  <p>Please ping an admin: Undo, ArtOfCode, hichris123, angussidney, or Andy.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="add-userscript">I have a userscript which is useful to the regulars of Charcoal HQ, and I’d like to get it included in the Userscripts repository. How can I get that to happen?</h2>

  <p>Ping Undo, ArtOfCode or angussidney, and they will give you push access to the repository to add your US. While you are waiting, you can make a pull request to add the userscript to the repo. Don’t forget to leave a message in CHQ to let people know about it!</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="code">There’s some other code that I’d like to contribute, who can I talk to to get it included?</h2>

  <p>Just make a pull request to one of our repositories on GitHub, and one of the maintainers will review your code and merge it in. Note that some projects have Continuous Integration (CI) tests that needs to be passed before that can happen.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="private">I need to discuss something with the admins privately, how can I contact them?</h2>

  <p>Please email <a href="mailto:smokey@charcoal-se.org">smokey@charcoal-se.org</a>, and it will reach the right people.</p>
